- model.py - model architectures defined here
- prompt_adapted_segment_anything/modeling/svd_layers.py - code for the singular value tuning modifications used in the model
- train.py - code for general training, common to all datasets
- driver_scratchpad.py - driver code for training models. 
- eval/*/generate_predictions.py - code for generating results for a given dataset
- eval/*/generate_predictions.sh - script to run generate_predictions for generating results for all labels of interest.
- model_svdtuning.yml - config file for defining various model hyperparameters for SVDSAM
- config_<dataset_name>.yml - config file for defining various dataset related hyperparameters
  
## Example Usage for Training
```
python driver_scratchpad.py --model_config model_svdtuning.yml --data_config config_cholec8k.yml --save_path "./temp.pth"
```
Please refer to driver_scratchpad.py for other command line options and parameters.
